7. ★ 12V Cooling Fan (The Stronger, The better)
Recommend - "NF-F12 IndustrialPPC-3000 PWM"
8. Bluetooth HC-06
9. Motor Driver L298N(Control Fan) 

§Additionally, led, dot-matrix, illuminance sensor, buzzer. 

※Hardware Parts will be TOO difficult.※


1. Power Part
To turn on/off all power, Because there are two power supply(6V, 12V each Board,Motor Driver), Toggle switch must be double pin than original switch. 

※Toggle Switch -> if convert left pos is power off, convert right pos is power on.(Edge of "power on" is supplied directive battery)
